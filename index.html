  <p>Data artist <a href="http://www.stefanieposavec.co.uk/">Stefanie Posavec</a> will talk about her unique approach to visualising data. Eschewing the usual tools used for data visualisation she has evolved a unique approach which is both immersive and beautiful.</p>
  <p><img src="img/sep2014/posavec.jpg"</p>

    <li>what are the best tools for data visualisation?</li>
    <li>I'm working on a visualisation but feel stuck</li>
    <li>is there anyone who can help me with my data?</li> 
    <li>could we organise a workshop/hack-night/etc.?</li>
    <li>I've seen/made a data visualisation and would like to hear some opinions on it</li>

  <h4>22 July 2014 - Data Visualisation: The Good, the Bad and the Ugly</h4>
  <img src="img/jul2014/matrix.jpg">
  <p>The recent development in data visualisation tools has led to a blossoming of creativity resulting in more and more innovation and experimentation. It's safe to say that we're no longer bound to stock charts such as bar charts, pie charts, line graphs etc. when presenting our data. Is this a good thing?</p>
  <p>Some say <a href="http://www.perceptualedge.com/examples.php">keep it simple</a> whilst others like to <a href="http://moebio.com/">push the boundaries</a>.</p>
  <p>This evening we'll take a look at a bunch of data visualisations and discuss what works &amp; what doesn't.</p>
  <p>(You're also invited to bring a link to a data visualisation that you find interesting. If you're prepared to present it for 5-10 minutes, that'd be great, otherwise just <a href="contact">email me</a> the details.)</p>
  <p>We expect that the evening will be inspiring, informative and enlightening.</p>

  <h4>24 June 2014 - Data Visualisation: Tools and Processes</h4>
  <p>There's a huge number of tools for creating data visualisations, ranging from Excel &amp; Tableau, to programming environments such as Processing, R, Python and JavaScript, through to interactive environments such as NodeBox and it's not always easy to select the right one for the job.</p>
  <p>Therefore we'll give an overview of these toolsets with members of the community talking about their tools of choice. We will also start looking at the processes for transforming data into a visualisation.</p>
  <img src="img/jun2014/migration.jpg">
